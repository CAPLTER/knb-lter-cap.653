## CAP LTER Ecological Survey of Central Arizona (ESCA): parcels

### version history

- knb-lter-cap.653.3 2025-07-23

  - adds the 2021 survey data
  - standardizes social classes to poor, working_lower, middle, upper_middle,
  and rich; and adds corresponding table constraints
  - drops human_indicators, which are plot measurements that are not
  particularly relevant to the parcel survey (note that
  human_indicators_parcels has a social class so the human_indicators social
  class is not relevant)
  - omits structures
