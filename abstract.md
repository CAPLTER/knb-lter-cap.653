The Ecological Survey of Central Arizona (ESCA) is an extensive field survey
and integrated inventory designed to capture key ecological indicators of the
CAP LTER study area consisting of the urbanized, suburbanized, and agricultural
areas of metropolitan Phoenix and the surrounding Sonoran desert. The survey is
conducted every five years at approximately 200 sample plots (30m x 30m) that
were located randomly using a tessellation-stratified, dual-density sampling
design. Study plots cover habitats throughout the CAP LTER study area ranging
from native Sonoran desert sites to residential yards to an airport tarmac. 

In 2010, the survey was expanded to include an assessment of residential
parcels overlapping the survey plot at sites in residential areas. Many of the
same variables that are measured in the 30m x 30m survey plot are measured in
the parcel, including an inventory of perennial plants, and the biovolume of
trees. In addition, a detailed assessment of characteristics of the parcel is
performed. 

Investigators interested in data from the broader Ecological Survey of Central
Arizona that includes all survey plots can find those data in the Environmental
Data Initiative data repository at
