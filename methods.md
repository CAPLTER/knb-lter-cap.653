## CAP LTER Ecological Survey of Central Arizona methods (adapted from the field and lab protocol)
Version 2015

These methods were adapted from the CAP LTER Ecological Survey of Central
Arizona field and lab protocol. This protocol was based initially on the UFORE
FOREST SURVEY devised by Dave Nowak (BES), and has been updated with input from
CAP LTER PIs and field experience. The methods described here are most recently
based primarily on the 2015 survey, which for the first time, employed the use
of digital tablets for data collection in the field. As such, the methods
reference entering data at key locations in tablet forms but are otherwise
identical in practice to protocols of previous surveys.

The methods presented here are a subset of the overall survey methods that are
specific to the parcel component of the survey. Please see

for full survey methods.

### parcel survey

At all residential sites, survey characteristics of the parcel that most
overlaps with the 30 x 30m study plot â€“ if not accessible, survey the parcel
that is most accessible. Data are to be collected for both the front and back
yards if accessible.

**General parcel information**

* Note the plot ID (e.g., 'V12')
* Note parcel
* Note the parcel address
* Quantify land use of the plot (only of the plot; add 'landuses\_sampling\_event' group): percent of the plot area that is in the land use using the LTER land use categories 1 through 6. This will often be 100% (e.g., desert sites) but some plots will cover multiple categories (e.g., 60% residential, 40% street). Make sure percentages sum to 100%. Identify categories using outline codes (e.g., 1B1 for institutional (schools, churches, etc) sites).
* Note the use of buildings on the plot
* Record heights of buildings if present (add 'Plot structures' group): record the slope (in degrees) to the highest point and bottom of the structure from a known distance.
* Note surrounding transportation infrastructure that best reflects conditions at the parcel
* Note landscape practices
    + Does the landscape have a natural or manicured appearance?
    + Is the landscape maintained professionally?
    + Are plants in the landscape healthy and vigorous?
    + Are there any symptoms or signs of abiotic or biotic injury?
    + Watering regimes: drip or trickle, overhead spray, flood, hand watering, or not irrigated.
    + Estimate % of pervious area irrigated.
    + Veg types present: soil / trees / shrubs / succulents / herbaceous groundcover / other groundcover.

* Synoptic Plot Photos: take synoptic photos of the parcel to capture the essence of the plot; describe each photo in the description box.
* Note the type of residence
* Note approximate perceived social class of the neighborhood

**yard characteristics & features**

* For front and rear yards separately, note the qualities as prompted by the form
    + yard upkeep
    + yard orderliness
    + yard features
    + watering regimes
    + yard landscape type
    + amount of grass and characteristics (if present)
    + weeds
    + pruning
    + detailed assessment of grass (if present)
  
Add another 'front or back yard' group as access allows

### vegetation 

**trees and Saguaros**

* Note the plot ID (e.g., 'V12')
* ALL trees (including all palms) and Saguaros in the yard(s) are counted, measured, photographed, and their position recorded
* Note front or back yard assessment
* Add a 'Tree Data' group for each tree in the plot
* Note the ID of the tree if this information is known, knowable only by examining previous data sheets or from past high-resolution GPS files - you are unlikely to have this information
* Note the tree taxon. Select 'other' if the identity is not know. Record a new taxon or provide notes about the tree's identity if relevant.
* Take a photo of the tree
* Record the GPS position of the tree
* Note if a voucher was collected
* If a voucher was collected, provide information about the voucher in 'voucher details' - in most cases, this will simply be the hedge number but provide additional information if relevant. Collect a small sample. Collect specimens that have flowers, fruits, and roots when possible. Write "perennial" on herbarium envelope.
* Note the shape and class of each tree
* Note if the tree is also in a plot
* Note the tree shape
* Note the tree class
* Estimate the health of the canopy based on the condition of the leaves (% dead or senesced)
* Estimate the % of the canopy that is absent from a perfect circle or oval
* Measure stem diameter as Diameter at Breast Height (DBH 54") of all stems at breast height. If this is not feasible (e.g., many small stems that would yield a poor estimate of girth), record the trunk diameter at, preferably, ground height (DGH, diameter at ground height, where trunk emerges from ground), or, less desirable, at some other height. Note the measuring height (inches) and diameter on data sheet. For trees where multiple trunks are measured, sum the circumferences and report only the total number, note also the number of stems measured.
* Tree height: where possible, measure height of the tree and the bottom of the canopy directly with a measuring tape. Otherwise, from a known (and measured) distance where you can see the top and base of the tree, use a clinometer to record the angle (degree, left-side scale of clinometer) to the top of the tree, and angle to base of the tree (where the trunk emerges from the ground).
* Canopy dimensions: record the length of the living canopy along the N-S axis and E-W axes using a measuring tape. Measure the height to the bottom of the canopy above the ground. This is best addressed by using a meter tape but can be done with the clinometer if necessary. If using a clinometer, record the angle to the bottom of the canopy from a known distance.

**Shrubs and cacti other than Saguaros (shrub count):**

*ALL shrubs and cacti in the yard(s) are counted by species, segregated by yard
position (front, year). Note that this does not include Saguaros, which are
treated like trees.*

* Note the plot ID (e.g., 'V12')
* Note parcel
* Add a new 'front or back yard'
* Note the yard position (front, rear)
* Add a 'Survey data for taxon' group for each taxon
* Note the shrub taxon. Select 'other' if the identity is not know. Record a new taxon or provide notes about the plant's identity if relevant.
* note if the plant is a hedge
* Take a photo of the plant if relevant. Pictures of each plant are not required here, but take photos if the ID is questionable or if there is something unique about the plant(s) or setting that would be useful to document with a photograph.
* Note if a voucher was collected
* If a voucher was collected, provide information about the voucher in 'voucher details' - in most cases, this will simply be the shrub number but provide additional information if relevant. Collect a small sample. Collect specimens that have flowers, fruits, and roots when possible. Write "perennial" on herbarium envelope.
* Quantify the number of this type of plant in this particular yard (front, rear)
* Add a 'Survey data for taxon' group for each additional taxon
* Add another 'front or back yard' group note that you can end the survey and create a new form/instance of the 'other' yard if not convenient to measure at that time
